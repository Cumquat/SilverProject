A SilveStripe module to manage some basic, very basic projects. Currently just a project and task style system. This will continue to grow with the ability to add time logs against tasks and maybe evenif required milestones.
Please note one this project was inspired/copied from https://github.com/titledk/silverstripe-projectmanagement.
Also i am not a very good coder so please check.
This is for Silver Stripe version 3x.

Cheers
